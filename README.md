This project was very frustrating to me. The node page helped me a lot through the beginning of the assignment but when I got to the last 3 criteria I hit a wall hard. I was unable to figure out what was not working and all my attempts to fix it did not work. I signed up for a tutor so I can review this assignment and fix it in the future. I was unable to get more than one number to show up or get the other conditionals to work in tandem with the one that came first in the code. Hopefully I can learn what I was doing wrong and can quickly fix the application. 

Also I cannot figure out how to add a screenshot to this file, I will be adding it to the repository instead.
